# The Neural Network for Generating Italian Names

## Overview
This project aims to build a neural network capable of generating Italian names. The construction of this network is based on the principles and methodologies outlined in the paper [A Neural Probabilistic Language Model](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) by Yoshua Bengio et al. This model utilizes neural network-based approaches to capture the probabilistic structure of language, which we adapt to generate plausible Italian names.
The goal of this project was to build a neural network for generating italian names.
